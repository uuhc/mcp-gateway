## ✨ What is MCP Gateway?

**MCP Gateway** is a lightweight and highly available gateway service written in Go. It enables individuals and organizations to convert their existing MCP Servers and APIs into services compliant with the [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — all through configuration, with **zero code changes**.

### 🔧 Core Design Principles

- ✅ Zero Intrusion: Platform-agnostic, supports deployment on bare metal, VMs, ECS, Kubernetes, etc., without modifying existing infrastructure
- 🔄 Configuration-Driven: Convert legacy APIs to MCP Servers using YAML configuration — no code required
- 🪶 Lightweight & Efficient: Designed for minimal resource usage without compromising on performance or availability
- 🧭 Built-in Management UI: Ready-to-use web interface to simplify setup and reduce operational overhead

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

MCP Gateway supports a ready-to-run Docker deployment. Full deployment and configuration instructions are available in the [docs](https://mcp.ifuryst.com/getting-started/quick-start).

### Quick Launch with Docker

Configure environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-eed837fb0b4a62ee69abc29a983492b7PlsChangeMe"
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
export APISERVER_JWT_SECRET_KEY="fec6d38f73d4211318e7c85617f0e333PlsChangeMe"
export SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"
export SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD="297df52fbc321ebf7198d497fe1c9206PlsChangeMe"
```

Launch the container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name mcp-gateway \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -p 5234:5234 \
  -p 5235:5235 \
  -p 5335:5335 \
  -p 5236:5236 \
  -e ENV=production \
  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY} \
  -e OPENAI_MODEL=${OPENAI_MODEL} \
  -e APISERVER_JWT_SECRET_KEY=${APISERVER_JWT_SECRET_KEY} \
  -e SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME=${SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME} \
  -e SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD} \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/mcp-ecosystem/mcp-gateway/allinone:latest
```

### Access and Configuration

1. Access the Web Interface:
   - Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser
   - Login with the administrator credentials you configured

2. Add an MCP Server:
   - Copy the config from: https://github.com/mcp-ecosystem/mcp-gateway/blob/main/configs/proxy-mock-server.yaml
   - Click "Add MCP Server" in the web interface
   - Paste the configuration and save

### Available Endpoints

After configuration, the service will be available at these endpoints:

- MCP SSE: http://localhost:5235/mcp/user/sse
- MCP SSE Message: http://localhost:5235/mcp/user/message
- MCP Streamable HTTP: http://localhost:5235/mcp/user/mcp

Configure your MCP Client with the `/sse` or `/mcp` suffix URLs to start using it.

### Testing

You can test the service using:

1. The MCP Chat page in the web interface
2. Your own MCP Client (**recommended**)
